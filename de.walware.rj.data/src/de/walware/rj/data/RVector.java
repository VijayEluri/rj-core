/**
 * An R object is of the type {@link RObject#TYPE_VECTOR vector}, if it is an R
 * data object of an "atomic" mode without a dimension attribute (<code>dim</code>).
 * Such an R vector object is represented by an instance of this interface.
 * <p>
 * The real data is stored in a {@link RStore} accessible by {@link #getData()}.</p>
 * <p>
 * The type {@link RObject#TYPE_VECTOR vector} equates not the R command 
 * <code>is.vector(object)</code>, mainly because all attributes except the dimension 
 * are allowed (in the R function only the names attribute is allowed).  Especially
 * an R factor object is of the type {@link RObject#TYPE_VECTOR vector}, implements
 * RVector and has a data store of the type {@link RStore#FACTOR}.  Also another S3 
 * object based on a such a data object is of the type {@link RObject#TYPE_VECTOR vector}.
 * Whereas a S4 object is never directly of this type even the object simulates such
 * a data object in R. Such an object is of the type {@link RObject#TYPE_S4OBJECT S4 object},
 * and implements {@link RS4Object} with an object of the type {@link RObject#TYPE_VECTOR vector}
 * as data slot.</p>
 * <p>
 * The complementary type for objects with dimension attribute is the type
 * {@link RObject#TYPE_ARRAY array} and the interface {@link RArray}.
 * The data structure for multiple R objects is represented by the type 
 * {@link RObject#TYPE_LIST list} respectively the interface {@link RList}.</p>
 * 
 * @param <DataType> the type of the data store
